# LAYER 1 — FOUNDATIONAL ONTOLOGY
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The "grammar" of the ontology. Defines the most abstract categories
# that everything else specialises from. Inspired by BFO (ISO 21838-2)
# and the Common Core Ontologies, but simplified for enterprise use
# with plain-language names.
#
# This layer should almost NEVER change. It is locked by default.
#
# Each concept carries a `bfo_equivalent` annotation for formal
# interoperability with BFO-based ontology ecosystems.
