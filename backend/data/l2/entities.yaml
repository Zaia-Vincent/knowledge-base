# The Entity Pillar answers "Who is involved?" and "What things exist?"
#
# Organised into three branches under Entity (L1):
#   Actor   — people and organisations that can act intentionally
#   Object  — physical/tangible things that do not act
#   Place   — spatial regions (specialisations of L1 Place)
#
# Plus Role specialisations (from L1 Role, under Characteristic).
#
# Design principle: Actor and Object are SIBLINGS, not parent-child.
# A query for "all Actors" returns people and organisations but
# never products, assets, or facilities.
